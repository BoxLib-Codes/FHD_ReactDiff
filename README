These codes use the BoxLib framework to develop a fluctuating hydrodynamics code for simulating stochastic reaction-diffusion systems. Rather than using a Langevin description based on Gaussian white noise, reactions are treated in an equivalent manner to the reaction-diffusion master equation description.

Details can be found in the paper (see doc/FHD_ReactDiff.pdf *not yet*):

To compile the code, you need to also download the Fortran BoxLib library from
https://github.com/BoxLib-Codes/BoxLib

The executable codes are in the directory exec. Edit the makefile in
exec/test/GNUMakefile
and then do "make" to build the code.

Example input files are provided in the directory exec:
- inputs_Schlogl_1d is the steady state Schlogl model example described in Section V.A in Ref. [1]
- inputs_BPM_2d is the Turing-like pattern formation example described in Section V.B in Ref. [1]
- inputs_chemical_wave_3d is the spherical chemical wave propagation described in Section V.C in Ref. [1]

You can run these examples by providing the input filename after the executable, for example:
./main.Linux.gfortran.mpi.exe inputs_Schlogl_1d
mpiexec -n 4 ./main.Linux.gfortran.mpi.exe inputs_BPM_2d

For the visulazation of results (BPM_2d and chemical_wave_3d), see Section "Visualization Using VisIt" in BoxLib User's Guid.

Caveats: 
1) The code used to perform structure factor analysis is not included in this distribution.
